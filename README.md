# EthereumTransactionCreator
Creating offline ethereum transactions by looking at a contract's abi

This project is part of a process.  Ultimately private keys and therefore the creation and signing of transactions should happen in a completely separate environment (for example on a Thales HSM).  This project helps to separate the concerns between the creation/signing of the transaction and the submitting/processing of that transaction on the blockchain.
